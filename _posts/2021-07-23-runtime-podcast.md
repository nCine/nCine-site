The nCine and its ten years of development are the main focus of the [fifth episode](https://runtimepodcast.com/#5) of _The Runtime_, a podcast about software development.

I have been interviewed by [Rafael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/rafajkennedy) about my work on the nCine during those years: from why I felt the urge to start developing it to some of the design decisions and trade-offs I had to made.
