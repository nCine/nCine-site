Today I gave a presentation for [GRInteractiva](https://twitter.com/GRinteractiva) about in-house custom engines: why they are so important, what are some indie games based on custom technology and, of course, a small overview of the nCine.

The slides are made with Remark and are available on [GitHub](https://encelo.github.io/CustomEnginesPresentation/).

An attendee also wrote an [article](https://www.mauricioluque.com/ciencia-y-tecnologia/20240307-motores-personalizados-en-videojuegos/) in Spanish about the talk. :wink:
