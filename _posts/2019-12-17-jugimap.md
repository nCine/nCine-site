A new version of the [JugiMap](http://jugimap.com/) map editor tool has been released and it now officially supports the nCine!
You can use the [JugiMap Framework](https://github.com/Jugilus/JugiMapFramework) to load a map created with the tool.

On its website you can try a web version of the [Framework Demo](https://jugilus.github.io/Jugimap-FrameworkDemo/JugimapFrameworkDemo.html) that uses the nCine. :wink:

On GitHub you will find the [ncJugiMapFrameworkDemo](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapFrameworkDemo) and the [ncJugiMapFrameworkDemo-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapFrameworkDemo-data) repositories for you to build the test.
