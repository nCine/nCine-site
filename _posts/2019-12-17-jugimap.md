A new version of the [JugiMap](http://jugimap.com/) map editor tool has been released and it now officially supports the nCine!
You can use the [JugiMap API](https://github.com/Jugilus/jugimapAPI) to load a map created with the tool.

On its website you can try a web version of the [API Demo Test](https://jugilus.github.io/ApiDemoTestWeb/JugimapApiDemoTest.html) that uses the nCine. :wink:

On GitHub you will find the [ncJugiMapAPIDemo](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapAPIDemo) and the [ncJugiMapAPIDemo-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapAPIDemo-data) repositories for you to build the test.
