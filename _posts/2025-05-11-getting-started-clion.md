It has been only a bunch of days since JetBrains [announced](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2025/05/clion-is-now-free-for-non-commercial-use/) that its C++ IDE is now free for non-commercial use.

To celebrate for this happy news, the wiki has now an [article](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/wiki/Getting-Started-with-C++-CLion) showing how to setup the IDE to work with the nCine and its projects!
