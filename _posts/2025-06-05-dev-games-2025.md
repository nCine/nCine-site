On June 5th I attended [/dev/games](https://devgames.org), a two-day game development conference held in Rome.

I gave a talk about my 14-year journey developing nCine, sharing both challenges and achievements, and diving into a selection of technical details.

You can check out the interactive [slides](https://encelo.github.io/nCine_14Years_Presentation/) made with Sli.dev, or download the [PDF version](https://encelo.github.io/nCine_14Years_Presentation/nCine_14Years.pdf).

A video recording will be available in the coming months on the conference's official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@devgamesconf).
