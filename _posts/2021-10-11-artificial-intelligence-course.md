The nCine has been recommended as the framework to be used by students for the second lesson homerwork of the [Artificial Intelligence for Computer Games](https://gamedev.cuni.cz/study/courses-history/courses-2021-2022/artificial-intelligence-for-computer-games-winter-2021-22/) course at the prestigious Charles University in Prague.

Many thanks to Dr. Jakub Gemrot for choosing the project, for providing a custom installation guide for students, and for his [feedback](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/issues/15) about the Windows build instructions.
