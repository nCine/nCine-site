[SUGO](https://sugo.gameloop.it/) is a new Italian magazine about indie game development in Italy, with a nice impagination derived from traditional medias and distributed as a PDF.

In the first issue that just came out today, there is an article I wrote about the story behind nCine development.

If you understand Italian grab a [copy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ESRh2pKn__hPKEzAhkkiH1RVCUApW5y7) and let me know what you think!
