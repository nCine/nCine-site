ncTiledViewer is a viewer for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps with an ImGui interface. It is able to parse TMX and TSX files using [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) and then display the map using sprites.

On GitHub you will find the [ncTiledViewer](https://github.com/nCine/ncTiledViewer) and the [ncTiledViewer-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncTiledViewer-data) repositories for you to build the application.

You will also find the same [demo](/nctiledviewer) among the [web-tests](/web-tests).
