- Renamed `ncine.audiobuffer_player` to `ncine.audio_buffer_player` in the Lua API
  - Renamed `get_audiobuffer()` and `set_audiobuffer()` to `get_audio_buffer()` and `set_audio_buffer()`
- Renamed `ncine.audiostream_player` to `ncine.audio_stream_player` in the Lua API
  - Renamed `num_samples_in_streambuffer()` and `streambuffer_size()` to `num_samples_in_stream_buffer()` and `stream_buffer_size()`

### Improvements

- The version of the integrated ImGui has been updated to [v1.91.6](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.91.6)
- The version of the integrated Google Benchmark has been updated to [v1.9.1](https://github.com/google/benchmark/releases/tag/v1.9.1)
- The GameController mapping database has been updated to the one in SDL 2.30.10

## November 2024

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `permissions()` to `get_permissions()` in the filesystem table of the Lua API
- Removed the `get_` prefix from `get_num_vertices()`, `get_num_bytes()`, and `get_num_indices()` in the mesh sprite Lua functions

### Improvements

- Lua statistics are now disabled by default to enable hooking by external debuggers like the [Lua Local Debugger](https://github.com/tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode)
- The version of the integrated ImGui has been updated to [v1.91.5](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.91.5)
- Multiple additions, fixes, and expansions to the Doxygen documentation
- Added some new Lua API functions
  - Added `input.num_joymappings()` to return the number of available mappings for joysticks
  - Added `particle_affector.get_base_scale()` to return the base scale factor of a size affector
  - Added a constructor overload that takes the position as a vector for animated and mesh sprites
- Many viewport, shader, and shaderstate Lua functions now return a boolean to indicate the result
- When calling the Lua `particle_system.add_size_affector()` function, you can now use a `vec2` for the scale factors

### Fixes

- Added missing overload constructors for mesh and animated sprites in the Lua API
- Added some missing button names for mapped joysticks in the Lua API
- Minimum CMake version has been raised to 3.10 to avoid a deprecation warning
- Added the missing `dpi` field to the Lua table returned by `gfx_device.get_monitor()`
- Fixed the Lua `viewport.set_camera()` function to accept `nil` as a camera parameter
- Added missing joystick buttons to Lua input event tables
