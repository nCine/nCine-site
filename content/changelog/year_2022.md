- Added missing getters and more methods to the Lua API of the `MeshSprite` class
- Updated support for Gradle plugin 7.2.0, build tools 33.0.0, and NDK r25 on Android
- Added support for the `Vector4` class in the Lua API

### Fixes

- Added the missing SceneNode::lastFrameUpdated() method to the Lua API
- You will never see again errors about reserved OpenGL uniforms or attributes not being found (like `gl_VertexID`)
- Non-compiling shaders will not fatal assert like they did before
- Fixes to the methods dealing with vertices and indices of the Lua API of the `MeshSprite` class

## June 2022

### Breaking Changes

  - This allows for texture sharing (like an atlas) or textures constructed from texels

## April 2022

### Breaking Changes

- The `DrawableNode::LayerBase` enumeration has been deleted
  - This also means that `TextNode` will not be on a higher layer by default
- The `SceneNode::draw()` method now returns a boolean to indicate if it has been rendered

### New Features

- The Qt5 widget exposes a flag to disable per-frame updates
- It is now possible to retrieve last frame AABB of a `DrawableNode`
- More information will be presented when the OpenGL debug context is enabled (marker annotations)

### Fixes

- The fixed capacity property is now correctly initialized when copy constructing, move constructing, and move assign a `String`
- A `Sprite` or a `MeshSprite` without a texture would make the application crash when a texture was assigned
- A `TextNode` without a font would make the application crash when a font was assigned
- A scene node with a negative scale factor will invert its rotation sign

## January 2022

### Breaking Changes

- The public `x` and `y` fields of a `SceneNode` have been made protected for consistency
- The `IGfxDevice` interface cannot set the OpenGL viewport and clear color, use viewports instead

### New Features

- Multiple viewports to support offscreen rendering or split screen
- A camera system to move around without transforming a parent node (slow on the CPU)

- There is now a centralized pool of render commands that serves multiple classes
- There are now OpenGL state classes to track the viewport and the clear color
