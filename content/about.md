Yet another game engine, what a complete waste of time! Am I right? :unamused:

Well, it surely wasn't a waste of time for me, I learned plenty of stuff and had a lot of fun programming it.
And it has also started to be useful to others!

It might not captivate the interest of who uses big engines like [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com), [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), but it should attract users of frameworks like [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d.org/), [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/), [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/), [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/), or [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

### Some use cases

**1.** It could be used for small cross-platform **2D games**. You can program your game in C++ for maximum performance and the ability to customize the engine itself or you can use the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) bindings for prototypes or game jams.

**2.** You can use the [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) integration and put together **game developing tools** like I did with my [particle editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLNI5NMCJ1E) or with [SpookyGhost](https://encelo.itch.io/spookyghost). They would be cross-platform and work on Android and the web as well.

**3.** When compiled as a static library it becomes a **graphics demo framework** and every low-level implementation class would be accessible, including the OpenGL and threading layers.
  All the other features would still be available, like the cross-platform abstraction, the template library, or the [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) and [Tracy](https://bitbucket.org/wolfpld/tracy/src/master/) integrations.

**4.** Being a minimal open source engine programmed by a single person, it can represent a starting point to **learn and experiment** with game engine programming. :wink:
