If you go on GitHub today you will find the [ncTemplate](https://github.com/nCine/ncTemplate) and [ncTemplate-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncTemplate-data) repositories.

You can use them as a starting point for your nCine projects.

ncPong, ncParticleEditor and ncInvaders have been adapted to use the new template scripts.
