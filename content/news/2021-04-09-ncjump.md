A new [release](https://github.com/Fahien/ncJump/releases/tag/2021.04) of ncJump has been published today by [Antonio "Fahien" Caggiano](https://www.antoniocaggiano.eu/).

ncJump is a platform game that uses Box2D for the physics, ImGui for the editor and of course the nCine.
It has been developed as an nCine reference version of the [CS50's lecture 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/weeks/4/).

On Fahien's GitHub you can find the [ncJump](https://github.com/Fahien/ncJump), [ncJump-data](https://github.com/Fahien/ncJump-data) and [ncJump-artifacts](https://github.com/Fahien/ncJump-artifacts) repositories.

You can read progress update articles and interact with the author on both [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/discussions/10) and [Itch.io](https://fahien.itch.io/ncjump).

As with other nCine projects, there is an Emscripten version that you can try [online](https://www.antoniocaggiano.eu/ncJump-artifacts/) on Fahien's site.
