Today I decided to publish [pmTracer](https://github.com/encelo/pmTracer) and [ncTracer](https://github.com/encelo/ncTracer) on my personal GitHub space.
You will also find online the [ncTracer-data](https://github.com/encelo/ncTracer-data) and the [ncTracer-artifacts](https://github.com/encelo/ncTracer-artifacts) repositories.

I have been working on the first, a ray tracing and path tracing library, for quite some time now. It is based on my studies of [_Ray Tracing from the Ground Up_](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/) by Kevin Suffern, a book I recommend if you want to start from scratch on the topic and before delving into the more complete but also harder to understand [_Physically Based Rendering:From Theory To Implementation_](http://www.pbr-book.org/). :wink:

I also developed an ImGui front-end to make it easier to perform tests and gather important feedback about speed and correctness, two things that are severely lacking at the moment. :sweat_smile:

But I decided to publish both projects either way because it can give me the motivation to refine them and you the opportunity to have a look at an application that uses the OpenGL and the threading private API of nCine by compiling it statically.

You can try the Emscripten version [here](/nctracer).
