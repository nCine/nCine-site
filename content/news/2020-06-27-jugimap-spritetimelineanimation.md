The third [JugiMap Framework](https://github.com/Jugilus/JugiMapFramework) demo by [Jugilus](https://github.com/Jugilus/) that shows how to animate sprites with the new timeline feature has been published on GitHub.

You will find the [ncJugiMapSpriteTimelineAnimation](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapSpriteTimelineAnimation) and the [ncJugiMapSpriteTimelineAnimation-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapSpriteTimelineAnimation-data) repositories for you to build the test.

You will also find the same [demo](/web-tests/ncjugimap_spritetimelineanimation) among the [web-tests](/web-tests).
