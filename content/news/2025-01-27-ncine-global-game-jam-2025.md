This past weekend me and [Cominu](https://bsky.app/profile/cominu.bsky.social) have participated to the Global Game Jam 2025 in [Granada](https://globalgamejam.granadajam.com/).
I was there as both a jammer and an official sponsor with the nCine! :muscle:

With the help of two graphic artists we put together a nice little game made with the nCine, called [Papel Mojado](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/papel-mojado-9).

In the live video from the jam location you can see both a short [presentation](https://youtu.be/IIUFbT1sah4?t=467) of our game and me giving away an nCine mug as a [sponsor price](https://youtu.be/IIUFbT1sah4?t=5043) :D
