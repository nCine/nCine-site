There is a new [JugiMap Framework](https://github.com/Jugilus/JugiMapFramework) demo published by [Jugilus](https://github.com/Jugilus/) that shows how to render a beautiful parallax scrolling landscape.

On GitHub you will find the [ncJugiMapParallaxScrolling](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapParallaxScrolling) and the [ncJugiMapParallaxScrolling-data](https://github.com/nCine/ncJugiMapParallaxScrolling-data) repositories for you to build the test.

You will also find the same [demo](/web-tests/ncjugimap_parallaxscrolling) among the [web-tests](/web-tests).
