The time has come, the source code has been released!
Go on GitHub and take a look at the [nCine organization](https://github.com/nCine).

You will find the [engine](https://github.com/nCine/nCine) code, the [Pong](https://github.com/nCine/ncPong) example project, the [particle editor](https://github.com/nCine/ncParticleEditor), the data sets, the CMake scripts used to compile all the dependency libraries on [PC](https://github.com/nCine/nCine-libraries) and [Android](https://github.com/nCine/nCine-android-libraries), the Jekyll [website](https://github.com/nCine/nCine-site) and the artifacts from the Azure Pipelines [continuous integration](https://dev.azure.com/encelo/nCine/).

Follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nCine2D) and come on [Discord](https://discord.gg/495ab6Y) to share your ideas and your nCine games! :wink:
