The game has seen many improvements since its original Global Game Jam 2025 submission:

- The codebase has been substantially cleaned up, making it a great starting point for learning the nCine API.
- The ImGui debug interface has been rewritten to be more consistent and useful.
- A (skippable) splash screen now welcomes you with the nCine logo. ðŸ˜‰
- You can play with a friend, just like in the original version, or go solo.
- A proper menu system has been added, fully navigable via keyboard or gamepad.
- Controls are fully rebindable â€” assign any key or gamepad button to your preferred actions.
- Game settings are saved on exit and reloaded on startup.
- Match statistics are now saved while you play.
- Bubbles feature a custom refraction shader, and the game view blurs when paused.
- Music now plays both in the menus and during gameplay.
- Gamepads will vibrate when you pop a bubble!
