On June 5th I attended [/dev/games](https://devgames.org), a two-day game development conference held in Rome.

Now, after five months, the recording of the talk about my 14-year journey developing nCine, has been published on YouTube on the official conference [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@devgamesconf).

You can check out online the [slides](https://encelo.github.io/nCine_14Years_Presentation/) or download a [PDF version](https://encelo.github.io/nCine_14Years_Presentation/nCine_14Years.pdf).
