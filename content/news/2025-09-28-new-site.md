After many years with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme by [Dean Attali](https://attalitech.com/), the nCine official site gets a revamp thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and powered by the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme by [Nuno Coração](https://n9o.xyz/). :rocket:

The move brings faster builds, more flexibility, and a cleaner design. You'll also find improved navigation, better support for images and charts, and dark mode out of the box.
