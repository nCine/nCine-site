It is now possible to use [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) as an input and window management backend on desktop platforms.

The engine will render inside a custom `QOpenGLWidget` and receive all input events from Qt5.
if [Qt Gamepad](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtgamepad-index.html) is available gamepad events will be received as well.
