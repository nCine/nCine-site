There is a new [Getting Started](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/wiki/Getting-Started) guide in the project wiki.
It comes with many screenshots, covers both Lua and C++, and it should be easy to follow.

The C++ part of the guide targets three different IDEs: Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, and Qt Creator.

I have removed any references to the old GitHub releases from the site. I have collated all the changes they introduced in a new [Changelog](/changelog) page.

I have also removed the links to the video tutorials from the wiki, they were deprecated and confusing. The videos have been unlisted from the Youtube channel.

I hope those changes better reflect the current state of the project and its setup process. :ok_hand:
