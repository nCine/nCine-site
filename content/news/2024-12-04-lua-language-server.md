Today you can find the nCine among the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/) official [addons](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons/tree/main/addons/ncine)!

If you are using Visual Studio Code, autocomplete, type checking, and full API documentation are only one click away.

Lua development experience should be now on par with other Lua scriptable frameworks, making the whole process more pleasant and functional.

If you also install the [Local Lua Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode) extension, you should have all the tools needed to create nice games with Lua and the nCine.

Please refer to the updated [Wiki](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Lua) for more details.
