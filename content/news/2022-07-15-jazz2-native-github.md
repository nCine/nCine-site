[Jazz² Resurrection](http://deat.tk/jazz2/) is reimplementation of Jazz Jackrabbit 2, a 1998 platform game by Epic Games (at the time called Epic MegaGames).
The author, [DeathKiller](https://github.com/deathkiller), used C# and parts of the Duality 2D framework to put together the project.

He is now porting it to C++ and he decided to use nCine for the job! :muscle:

The native project embeds a modified version of the engine to make the porting easier and faster.
You can have a look at the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2-native).
