The [develop](https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop) branch will be the base for a future release.

## Changelog

### Breaking Changes
- The `nctl::Array` and `nctl::StaticArray` subscript operator will not grow the array size
- The return type of the `createAppEventHandler` function has been changed to a unique pointer

### New Features
- The engine now supports custom memory allocators
  - All containers have been updated to allow the specification of an allocator
  - Unique pointers support custom deleters in a compressed pair
  - A new `apptest_allocators` application has been added to test the four included allocator types
- The FileSystem API now supports Android asset FileSystem

### Improvements
- All containers now split the allocation phase from object construction
  - Creating a container will only reserve memory for the elements
  - Inserting or removing elements will trigger construction and destruction
- On Android unfound libraries will not be linked anymore to the game library
  - The Java activity will not load the nCine or OpenAL libraries if unneeded

### Fixes
- GCC hardening compiler flags have been fixed with the explicit addition of PIE flags
