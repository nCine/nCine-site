I'm a former engine programmer from the AAA game industry that has been pursuing a dream since 2011: to write my own engine and witness what people can create with it!

nCine is a cross-platform 2D game engine written in C++ with an emphasis on performance that is also scriptable in Lua for more flexibility.
You can use it to create your games and tools or to learn and experiment with its source code.

With your donations I can bring my commitment to a whole new level and push even harder in important aspects like performance, usability and extensibility.
